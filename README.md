# Java Compiler

The provided program is a basic Java compiler that tokenizes code and displays the tokens in a table using a GUI. It can be executed by compiling the Compiler class and running it without any command-line arguments. The code file to be compiled is specified in the FILE_PATH constant within the Compiler class. The program supports a limited set of keywords and token types and can be extended for more complex compiler projects.
